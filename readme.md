# TrackItBack - Recovering Lost Items

## Project Overview

TrackItBack is a web-based platform designed to help users report, find, and claim lost items in public places. The project provides a structured and reliable system for connecting finders and owners, improving the chances of recovering lost belongings. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), it ensures a scalable and responsive application. MongoDB is used for storing user details, lost and found item records, and handling real-time notifications. Express and Node.js implement authentication, API endpoints for CRUD operations, and real-time notifications using WebSockets while integrating MongoDB with Mongoose. React provides an interactive UI with real-time updates and intuitive styling.

## Problem Statement

People frequently lose or find items in public spaces without an efficient way to report or claim them. Those who find lost items struggle to return them due to the lack of an organized system. TrackItBack aims to bridge this gap by providing a seamless reporting and matching system.
